# IncludeBuild Images

This directory contains images for the IncludeBuild documentation.

## Required Images

The following image files are referenced in the documentation:

- `includebuild-banner.png` - Main banner image used in the README.md

Currently, these images do not exist and should be created for a complete visual identity.

## Image Creation Guidelines

When creating these images, follow the visual identity guidelines from the BRAND-DESIGN.md document:

- Use the official color palette
- Include the `#include "build.h"` directive in the logo
- Use monospaced fonts for code elements
- Consider syntax highlighting for code snippets
