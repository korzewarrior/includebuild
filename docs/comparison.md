### IncludeBuild vs. Bazel

**Similarities:**
- Both can handle multiple targets
- Both can be used for cross-platform development

**Key Differences:**
- IncludeBuild is minimalist; Bazel is designed for large-scale development
- Bazel has many more features and dependencies
- Bazel is specifically designed for monorepo development
- Bazel has a much steeper learning curve
- Bazel is more focused on reproducible builds and hermeticity

**When to choose IncludeBuild over Bazel:**
- Your project is small to medium in size
- You want a simpler approach without many dependencies
- You don't need the advanced features Bazel provides
- You want to avoid Bazel's complexity and learning curve

**When to choose Bazel over IncludeBuild:**
- You're working on a large-scale project
- You need advanced caching and build optimization
- You're working in a monorepo environment
- You need fine-grained dependency management
- You need hermetic builds

## Conclusion

IncludeBuild stands out for its minimalist approach, zero dependencies, and straightforward C-based interface. It's ideal for small to medium-sized projects where simplicity and ease of setup are priorities.

The key advantages of IncludeBuild are:

1. **Simplicity**: A single header file with zero dependencies
2. **Familiar language**: If you're already writing C/C++ code, you don't need to learn a new language
3. **Programmability**: Direct access to the full power of C for your build scripts
4. **Portability**: Works across platforms without configuration
5. **Transparency**: Easy to understand and modify

However, for larger projects with complex dependency needs, more advanced systems like CMake, Meson, or Bazel may provide more appropriate tooling. The right choice depends on your specific project requirements, team familiarity, and the scale of your development effort.
